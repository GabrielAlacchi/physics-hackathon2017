    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
		<p>Prior to arriving at the hackathon, Abtin, Gabe, Hansen and Vincent contemplated for days about what they were going to tackle for this year’s event.  The sleep deprived group of undergraduates fought, battled and cried over different ideas ranging from solving the Schrödinger equation for arbitrary potentials to modelling the gyroscopic dynamics of coupled fidget spinners. It wasn’t until a few hours after registration that this team of four McGill undergrads slowly converged to a project idea.  For this year’s physics hackathon, the group decided to take on the challenge of modelling basic traffic dynamics formed by a network of vertices and edges. <br><br>The motivation for this project was purely based on its HC (how cool) factor. Dimensional analysis showed that the HC factor of this project was three orders of magnitude greater than what was estimated for competing ideas. Historically, the HC factor has been observed to be inversely proportional to its applicability to the real world.  This hackathon project seeks to break this empirical law.

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
		<p>

			The process and assumptions used to model the walkers will be presented in this section. <br><br>

			Model and Notation:<br><br>

			V = set of all vertices v_k<br>

			E = set of all edges e_ij with direction from vertices v_i to v_j<br>

			n_ij = number of walkers from vertex v_i to v_j along e_ij<br>

			s_ij = speed of a car along edge e_ij<br>

			A = adjacency matrix connecting vertices v_i to v_j.  A_ij = 1 if v_i and v_j connected and 0 otherwise.  Clearly A_ij is symmetric positive definite.<br><br>

			Basic assumptions to the model:<br><br>

			We model a walking grid as a set of vertices interconnected by edges.  Naturally, the paths are represented by edges and intersections by vertices.  The probability of a walker at vertex v_i to travel along e_ij to vertex v_j depends on the number of walkers travelling along e_ij.  Namely, P(e_ij) = f(n_ij).   The time step of a walker along edge e_ij is denoted as t_ij. t_ij is also a function of the number of walkers present on the edge e_ij.  That is, t_ij = n_(ij).  The goal is to find the time evolution of system of walkers populating these edges.  We seek to determine how the time steps varies over time under different probabilistic models. <br><br>

      <h3><b>Example of Walker Decision-Making</b></h3>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
		<p>
		
			Each walker will have a position between the nodes at any point in time, also known as an edge. Once sufficient time steps have passed for the walker to have crossed the edge that it is on, it must decide which direction
			to go in next. Each of the possible paths for the walker have a certain probability, and the decision made by the walker is governed from the probability of each path. Furthermore, the probability for the walker to take 
			certain path also depends on the total number of walkers on the path. The more walkers currently on a path, the less likely that new walkers will take that path (emulating the tendency for people to avoid congested roads).
			 The walker also has a chance to "despawn", and this chance increases with time to illustrate that drivers are reaching their destinations. When a walker reaches its destination, a new walker will "spawn" in to replace it.
